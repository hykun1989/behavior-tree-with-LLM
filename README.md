# behavior-tree-with-LLM
This project is at the forefront of exploring dynamic behavior tree revision utilizing Large Language Models (LLM), particularly focusing on their application in open-world scenarios. The core of the research involves leveraging LLMs to modify behavior trees, facilitating sophisticated exploration strategies within complex environments. The primary environment for this exploration is the highway-v0 environment from the gymnasium open-source library.
