Enviroment Overview:
You are in control of an autonomous vehicle, referred to as the 'ego car', navigating a busy highway. The prime directive for the ego car is to maximize its speed while ensuring a collision-free journey amidst other vehicles.

Available Actions (ACTIONS_ALL):
The ego car can perform the following actions:

0: 'change_lane_left' - Move the ego car to the left lane.
1: 'idle' - Keep the ego car's speed constant.
2: 'change_lane_right' - Move the ego car to the right lane.
3: 'increase_speed' - Accelerate the ego car.
4: 'slower' - Decelerate the ego car.
Available Functions (FUNCTIONS_ALL):
The ego car has access to the following functions to assess its environment:

'check_traffic_ahead' - Ensure the road ahead is safe.
'check_right_lane_safe' - Verify if the adjacent right lane is safe for a lane change.
'check_left_lane_safe' - Verify if the adjacent left lane is safe for a lane change.
'check_need_to_slow' - Determine if slowing down is necessary due to traffic ahead.
'check_need_to_idle' - Ascertain if maintaining the current speed is safe given the traffic conditions.
Restrictions:
Your strategy should only utilize the above-mentioned actions and functions to formulate the behavior tree.

Previous Behavior Tree Structure:
The initial behavior tree structure was as follows:

Procedure:{
    Do phase 1:{
        Do phase 1-1:{
            "check_traffic_ahead"
        }Do phase 1-2 if 1-1 success:{
            "increase_speed"
        }
    }Do phase 2 if 1 failed:{
        Do phase 2-1:{
            "check_left_lane_safe"
        }Do phase 2-2 if 2-1 success:{
            "change_lane_left"
        }
    }Do phase 3 if 2 failed:{
        Do phase 3-1:{
            "check_right_lane_safe"
        }Do phase 3-2 if 3-1 success:{
            "change_lane_right"
        }
    }Do phase 4 if 3 failed:{
        Do phase 4-1:{
            "check_need_to_slow"
        }Do phase 4-2 if 4-1 success:{
            "slower"
        }
    }Do phase 5 if 4 failed:{
        Do phase 5-1:{
            "check_need_to_idle"
        }Do phase 5-2 if 5-1 success:{
            "idle"
        }
    }
}
However, this tree structure led to a collision. You need to modify the behavior tree structure to prioritize avoiding collisions while striving to maintain a high speed.

Task:
Devise a revised behavior tree structure to achieve high speed while ensuring safety by preventing collisions with surrounding vehicles.

Hint:
The format of the revised behavior tree is the same as before. And you are restricted to output only the behavior tree without any others.
